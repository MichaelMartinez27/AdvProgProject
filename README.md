# AdvProgProject

We will implement a project organizer where a user can create, edit, accomplish project tasks with others in an organization. There will be a front end GUI interface where the User has options to create, edit, or view projects which will be communicating with a backend that implements all the classes of creating users with permissions, creating projects, deleting projects, and viewing projects.
